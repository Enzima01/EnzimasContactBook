# Enzima's Contact Book (No Database Version)

This version of the Contact Book was created as a demonstration of how the system works without the need for a database connection.

All data is stored in memory temporarily and will be lost once the program is closed.

This application was built using Java Swing and is ideal for testing or showing how the interface and basic logic behave before connecting it to a real database.
